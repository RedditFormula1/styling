# styling
The styling for /r/Formula1

## How to use

Make sure Node JS is installed. You'll need it for this.

Then install Yarn. Go to your cmd / terminal and type `npm install -g yarn` (or one of the other options, npm is just the quickest).

In your terminal, go to the `styling` folder. You now have the following commands available:

`gulp build` - Makes a complete build of the styling, ready to be inserted on the sub.
`gulp dev` - Watches for changes in the SCSS files and runs a build whenever it detects a change.
`gulp clean` - Removes any past builds.

That's it. Knock yourself out!

## Coming soon

- Command to automatically put the styling on the sub
